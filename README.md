## Module Two Team Project Plan
Bri Banuelos, Emma Kurtz, Nikki Malmanger, Dustin Prinkley, Alexis Skeen
** We all worked on this together in a team meeting, so we all contributed together :)

  ### Choose a scenario and select the four additional elements you will include.
      > Our scenario will be a Sidescrolling Platformer game.
        Enemies (Moving) (2 types, can be moving on platforms or jumping around)
        Obstacles (Stationary) (4 unique types; scattered about the level. Will harm player or cause an 
      effect)
        Player Pickups (Health, power ups, etc.) (at least 3 unique types, can be placed scattered around 
      level)
        Collectables (These are the collectables for the finish. For example, the player may need to 
      collect 10 keys before exiting the level.) 
  ### Brainstorm on content based on the preferred scenario in the design document.
      > Cat Cafe theme
        Cat condos, tables, chairs, cat towers, register and pastry display, cat toys on the floor
        Player is a cat
        Collectables: 10 Kittens that the player must find
        Enemies: Customers (Try to grab you and pick you up), Workers with spray bottle (should be placed by tables, or by register) 
        Obstacles: Yarn Balls cause the player to bounce either to the side or upwards around, Quicksand Litterbox Trap (lose a part of your life),         Hairball that slows you down when in contact and hinders ability to jump, Catnip (Player Character gets distracted by catnip)
        Player Pickups: Health pickup (Glass of Milk), Speed pickup (Treats), Lure Pickup (Bell, signals kittens and their location)
  ### Create a schedule or timeline for developing your game based on due dates outlined within the course.
      >  Module 3: Concept Art & Theme Finalized. Some stuff set up in project, like camera movement. 
         Module 4 (Alpha Release): Player Movement and Jumping, Enemies and Enemy AI, Start and End Goals
         Module 5 (Beta Release): Pickups, Player Health Bar, Collectables, Obstacles
         Module 6: Optimizing & Polishing
         Module 7 (Final Release): Optimizing & Polishing & Finalizing Everything
  ### Determine the development goals for the Alpha and Beta Stage submissions (which assets/elements should be in place and what level of functionality you are going to use to track the project progress in the Alpha and Beta stages).
      > Alpha Release: We should have the easier to make platform assets done (tables, chairs) and other assets will have placeholders (untextured        blocks). Element assets relating to the timeline should also be done. 
      Beta Release: Cat condos, register and pastry display, cat toys, and other assets should be fully textured and made.
  ### Choose preferred communication method(s). Element assets relating to the timeline should also be done. 
      > Our preferred method of communication will be Discord.
  ### Choose the frequency of communication (team meeting).
      > Weekly team meeting at Wednesdays, and frequent communication in text.
  ### Choose a method for assigning and reporting on specific task items.
      > Discord team channel and GitHub comments for updates on task items.

## Module Three Project Log - Team Development: QA and Testing Plan

### How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
###  - Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage
          > We'll be testing the functionality of each thing in the game as we work on it. In addition, having another team
          member test the functionality ensures that the mechanic works across other devices.
###  - Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project
          > We will fix bugs based on priority, tackling the most severe ones first (like game-crashing or progress-breaking)
          so marketing is not given a unfinished product.
###  - Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
          > We'll compare what we have so far with the test plan and verify all priorities before release.
### What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
      > Items will be tested include the player, the pickups, enemy AI and their behavior, start and end goals,
      and each of their mechanics and functionalities to ensure that everything has been tested and documented on.
### How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
      > We will update the test plan, which is in our github repository, by documenting any changes in the updates/error resolutions tab.
### How will bugs be reported?
      > Bugs will be reported in our test plan in the reports tab and communicate with each other about the reports in Discord.
### How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
      > The bugs and their changes will be tracked via our test plan where we can write down in detail any updates to it.
