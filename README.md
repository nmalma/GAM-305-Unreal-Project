## Module Two Team Project Plan
Bri Banuelos, Emma Kurtz, Nikki Malmanger, Dustin Prinkley, Alexis Skeen
** We all worked on this together in a team meeting, so we all contributed together :)

  ### Choose a scenario and select the four additional elements you will include.
      Our scenario will be a Sidescrolling Platformer game.
      Enemies (Moving) (2 types, can be moving on platforms or jumping around)
      Obstacles (Stationary) (4 unique types; scattered about the level. Will harm player or cause an 
      effect)
      Player Pickups (Health, power ups, etc.) (at least 3 unique types, can be placed scattered around 
      level)
      Collectables (These are the collectables for the finish. For example, the player may need to 
      collect 10 keys before exiting the level.) 
  ### Brainstorm on content based on the preferred scenario in the design document.
      Cat Cafe theme
      Cat condos, tables, chairs, cat towers, register and pastry display, cat toys on the floor
      Player is a cat
      Collectables: 10 Kittens that the player must find
      Enemies: Customers (Try to grab you and pick you up), Workers with spray bottle (should be placed by tables, or by register) 
      Obstacles: Yarn Balls cause the player to bounce either to the side or upwards around, Quicksand Litterbox Trap (lose a part of your life),
      Hairball that slows you down when in contact and hinders ability to jump, Catnip (Player Character gets distracted by catnip)
      Player Pickups: Health pickup (Glass of Milk), Speed pickup (Treats), Lure Pickup (Bell, signals kittens and their location)
  ### Create a schedule or timeline for developing your game based on due dates outlined within the course.
      Module 3: Concept Art & Theme Finalized. Some stuff set up in project, like camera movement.
      Module 4 (Alpha Release): Player Movement and Jumping, Enemies and Enemy AI, Start and End Goals
      Module 5 (Beta Release): Pickups, Player Health Bar, Collectables, Obstacles
      Module 6 (Final Release): Texturing, Optimizing, and Polishing
  ### Determine the development goals for the Alpha and Beta Stage submissions (which assets/elements should be in place and what level of functionality you are going to use to track the project progress in the Alpha and Beta stages).
      Alpha Release: We should have the easier to make platform assets done (tables, chairs) and other assets will have placeholders (untextured blocks). Element assets relating to the timeline should also be done. 
      Beta Release: Cat condos, register and pastry display, cat toys, and other assets should be fully textured and made.
  ### Choose preferred communication method(s). Element assets relating to the timeline should also be done. 
      Our preferred method of communication will be Discord.
  ### Choose the frequency of communication (team meeting).
      Weekly team meeting at Wednesdays, and frequent communication in text.
  ### Choose a method for assigning and reporting on specific task items.
      Discord team channel and GitHub comments for updates on task items.

## Module Three Project Log - Team Development: QA and Testing Plan
Bri Banuelos, Emma Kurtz, Nikki Malmanger, Dustin Prinkley, Alexis Skeen
** We all worked on this together in a team meeting, so we all contributed together :)

### How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
###  - Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage
      We'll be testing the functionality of each thing in the game as we work on it. In addition, having another team
      member test the functionality ensures that the mechanic works across other devices.
###  - Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project
      We will fix bugs based on priority, tackling the most severe ones first (like game-crashing or progress-breaking)
      so marketing is not given a unfinished product.
###  - Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
      We'll compare what we have so far with the test plan and verify all priorities before release.
### What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
      Items will be tested include the player, the pickups, enemy AI and their behavior, start and end goals,
      and each of their mechanics and functionalities to ensure that everything has been tested and documented on.
### How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
      We will update the test plan, which is in our github repository, by documenting any changes in the updates/error resolutions tab.
### How will bugs be reported?
      Bugs will be reported in our test plan in the reports tab and communicate with each other about the reports in Discord.
### How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
      The bugs and their changes will be tracked via our test plan where we can write down in detail any updates to it.

### - What parts of the testing process did the team perceive to go well?
      Alexis, our level designer, had very minute issues. Since she is making the models in Blender, she has had to scale them in Unreal Engine so they are the proper size, but that's not as much of a bug and more of how Unreal Engine interprets the size of Blender models.
      Brie, one of our programmers, has made a lot of progress with the player movement, jumping, obstacle mechanics, and collectable mechanics. Going very smoothly, and when she has hit a roadblock has research solutions or took a break to tackle the problem with a pair of fresh eyes.
      Emma, our other programmer, is working on the Enemy AI and AI behaviors. She hasn't done much testing yet, but so far has gone well.
### - How were bugs identified and corrected?
      For Brie, she has gotten yellow errors and searched up solutions on why those errors were happening based on the information given.
      For Emma, the only bug she's encountered was when she used the wrong node for the enemy behavior. She also identified a problem in our Github Repository, being that it was still tracking files in the /Saved and /Immediate folders (which are mostly cache and irrelevant information to us) and was able to add them to the .gitignore file.
      For Dee (Dustin), she had a problem with Unreal Engine not being installed on her computer for a while. Luckily, she's only been making sprites and art which doesn't directly require use of the engine. And thankfully, she has been able to have Unreal Engine on her computer now after resetting her computer.
### - In terms of the QA and testing process, what would you do differently to improve the process?
      For Brie, she would have done the pickups and obstacles earlier so we could have that tested earlier.
      For Emma, she wouldn't have done anything differently.
### - What tools (chosen in Module Two) did you find successful in the development of your Alpha project? Why?
      We have a traceability matrix, test plan, and assets list in our Github Repository that has helped us greatly in updating our progress in the development of the game. Using Discord as our main form of communication, it has made communicating and updating each other on what we are doing much easier. We have also used Github Desktop to push and pull from origin, and create new branches onto the repository from our local computers. It's basically GitBash, but a lot more friendly looking and easier to understand. 
### - Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
      Alexis does not like having to scale the models from Blender to Unreal Engine. Brie and Emma do not have any issues. 
### - How did the team approach to the initial analysis of the game design document contribute to the decision to use these tools and techniques?
      The tools and techniques have helped us stay organized, scheduled, and keep us accountable.

### - What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage evaluation?
      We got the player set up and functioning. The obstacle collisions were working. 3/4 of the obstacles were done last week, meaning we got ahead of schedule, and the collectables were set up last week. Concept art was mostly finalized and sprites mostly done. Layout Blocking got finished and level design planned out. We also playtested often, including involving other non-programmer members in the playtesting.
### - What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage evaluation?
      There were a lot of GitHub issues and we had to replace an enemy concept with another. The GitHub issues had to do with a weird problem with the webcache data in our repository. We still don't know the "why" of why this has happened, but we have found solutions and workarounds on it and losing minimal progress. We also had a weird file corruption problem with one of our material files in our Unreal project, causing the level to be unable to load. We also had to replace an enemy concept design because we were having major collision problems with it and trying to make it interact with the player, but not the platforms. We ended up creating a new enemy that would directly be on the platforms and the player must jump over and avoid.
### - How were the previous evaluations integrated into this latest stage?
      With the change of the new enemy, the enemies will be much easier to program now. In addition, GitHub issues (hopefully) shouldn't be as prevalent as they were last week, as we have found solutions to them if they happen again. We will be able to focus more on how the game actually looks, since most of the obstacles are complete and we are ahead of schedule on certain things.
### - What would you do differently to improve the collaboration or development process?
      Non-programmers playtesting more frequently would help the programmers get more input and feedback on the controls and spot any bugs.
### - Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
      The video that was provided to package the project was outdated, and we had to resort to finding different tutorials to package it.
### - Identify the completed stage of development of the intended Beta and address the project schedule to meet Final Release development deadline.
      We already implemented the collectables and 3/4 of the obstacles last week, so we are ahead of schedule. Currently, we have the player health set up. All that is left is to implement the new enemy, the last obstacle, the pickups, and the player health. After that, it's texturing and finalizing everything. We will have to move the spawn point to the final release due to some repository issues during the end of the week.
