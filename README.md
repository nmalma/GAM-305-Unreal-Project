## Module Two Team Project Plan
  ### Choose a scenario and select the four additional elements you will include.
      > Our scenario will be a Sidescrolling Platformer game.
        Enemies (Moving) (2 types, can be moving on platforms or jumping around)
        Obstacles (Stationary) (4 unique types; scattered about the level. Will harm player or cause an 
      effect)
        Player Pickups (Health, power ups, etc.) (at least 3 unique types, can be placed scattered around 
      level)
        Collectables (These are the collectables for the finish. For example, the player may need to 
      collect 10 keys before exiting the level.) 
  ### Brainstorm on content based on the preferred scenario in the design document.
      > Cat Cafe theme
        Cat condos, tables, chairs, cat towers, register and pastry display, cat toys on the floor
        Player is a cat
        Collectables: 10 Kittens that the player must find
        Enemies: Customers (Try to grab you and pick you up), Workers with spray bottle (should be placed by tables, or by register) 
        Obstacles: Yarn Balls cause the player to bounce either to the side or upwards around, Quicksand Litterbox Trap (lose a part of your life), Hairball that slows you down when in contact and hinders ability to jump, Catnip (Player Character gets distracted by catnip)
      > Player Pickups: Health pickup (Glass of Milk), Speed pickup (Treats), Lure Pickup (Bell, signals kittens and their location)
  ### Create a schedule or timeline for developing your game based on due dates outlined within the course.
      >  Module 3: Concept Art & Theme Finalized. Some stuff set up in project, like camera movement. 
         Module 4 (Alpha Release): Player Movement and Jumping, Enemies and Enemy AI, Start and End Goals
         Module 5 (Beta Release): Pickups, Player Health Bar, Collectables, Obstacles
         Module 6: Optimizing & Polishing
         Module 7 (Final Release): Optimizing & Polishing & Finalizing Everything
  ### Determine the development goals for the Alpha and Beta Stage submissions (which assets/elements should be in place and what level of functionality you are going to use to track the project progress in the Alpha and Beta stages).
      > Alpha Release: We should have the easier to make platform assets done (tables, chairs) and other assets will have placeholders (untextured blocks). Element assets relating to the timeline should also be done. 
      Beta Release: Cat condos, register and pastry display, cat toys, and other assets should be fully textured and made.
  ### Choose preferred communication method(s). Element assets relating to the timeline should also be done. 
      > Our preferred method of communication will be Discord.
  ### Choose the frequency of communication (team meeting).
      > Weekly team meeting at Wednesdays, and frequent communication in text.
  ### Choose a method for assigning and reporting on specific task items.
      > Discord team channel and GitHub comments for updates on task items.
